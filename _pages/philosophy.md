I seek research questions in novel transportation applications at the intersection of rigorous mathematical methods and societal impact. I am comitted to leveraging my research interests to actively recruit, sustain, and support more women and underrepresented students in the STEM and transportation field, both in and outside the classroom. 

**Research**: My current research focuses on emerging modalities in urban mobility, leveraging data and optimization to enhance transportation systems. The wealth of new forms of data and new technologies in transportation raises key design and operatioanl questions in the transportation field. Namely, how can we enhance existing infrastructure in urban mobility, given emerging transportation modes? What does the design and operations of these new systems look like? These are questions that I seek to answer in my current and ongoing research. 

**Policy**: I strongly believe that shifting the field to change perspectives on transportation requires not just methodological research, but also policy outreach. To that goal, I am committed to informing broader policy audiences and engaging with transportation planning broadly. See the Articles section for more info. 

**Teaching**: Through my teaching, I seek to foster inclusive environments for students of diverse academic backgrounds, helping expose students to new problems that push their mathematical comfort zones. 

**Outreach**: Through my service engagements, my goal is to support fellow underrepresented graduate students through retention and recruitment efforts
