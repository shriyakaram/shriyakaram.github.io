I am motivated by novel transportation applications at the intersection of rigorous mathematical methods and societal impact. I am committed to leveraging my position to actively sustain students of diverse academic backgrounds, as well as recruiting and sustaining more women and underrepresented students in the STEM and transportation field. I drive this academic and personal agenda in the following ways: 

<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> **Research**: Urban mobility systems face growing challenges in sustaining demand and maintaining service quality. At the same time, the emergence of new data and advanced technologies is rapidly transforming the field of urban transportation. With this transformation, transportation planning agencies and urban mobility providers must adapt their design and operational strategies to best serve the individual users of their systems, requiring new tools to optimize these strategies. In my research, I develop new methods to design and operate urban transportation systems with a focus on individual needs. In doing so, I integrate methods in optimization and data-driven modeling using real-world data (such as historical passenger requests and social media feedback) to inform transportation planning decisions. 

<i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> **Policy**: I strongly believe that shifting the field to change perspectives on transportation requires not just methodological research, but also policy outreach. Because my research directly intersects with transportation planning, I seek opportunities to disseminate my work in accessible policy organizations. To that goal, I am committed to informing broader policy audiences about my research and engaging with transportation planning broadly. 

<i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> **Teaching**: I aspire to foster inclusive environments for students of diverse academic backgrounds, helping expose students to new problems that push their mathematical comfort zones. I seek opportunities that engage students from a variety of mathematical and professional depths: for instance, a student with a background in chemical engineering but less familarity in optimization, versus that of a transportation planner with years of professional experience. For each of these students, my teaching approach is individual-oriented, where I tailor my approach to best suit the student's background.

<i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> **Outreach**: As an individual deeply committed to supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds, I believe in leveraging my academic position to mentor and advise students seeking academic careers in transportation and engineering broadly.
