Shriya Karam is a second-year Ph.D. student advised by Alexandre Jacquillat in the Operations Research Center at MIT. My research focuses on emerging modalities in urban mobility, leveraging data and optimization to enhance transportation systems. Prior to joining MIT, I completed my BSE in Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, where I researched under Megan Ryerson. I am currently supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
