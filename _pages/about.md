I am a third-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Alexandre Jacquillat](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/alexandre-jacquillat "Prof. Alexandre Jacquillat") in the [Operations Research Center at MIT](https://orc.mit.edu "Operations Research Center at MIT"). My research focuses on the design and operations of urban transportation systems, leveraging methods in optimization and data-driven modeling. I am currently supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Prior to joining MIT, I completed my BSE in Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 2023, where I researched under [Prof. Megan Ryerson](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/megan-s-ryerson "Prof. Megan Ryerson").
